OOGA BOOGA!
Kaneda - release 10.1



INTRODUCTION

This is a VERY little game I (Kaneda) made for the y2kode competition.
It's a pure jump and run game.
I tried to use all the features of the Sega Genesis except Raster and 
Highlight since it's not quite good emulated, even FM Music!! See the
ending for this 2 channels song.
I also hide a cheat code :).

WORKING
I tested on all the emus i have and only found bugs on GenEm, Ages, Gens,
st0rm and VGen which are aborted projects or WIP.
I didn't try yet on a real Genesis.
